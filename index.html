            <p class="w-auto lg:mx-52 md:mx-42 sm:mx-10 text-lg text-center font-serif leading-6">Demon Slayer is a Japanese anime series that follows the main character Tanjiro Kamado and his sister Nezuko Kamado. Tanjiro is the only survivor of a vicious attack from a demon

            <p class="text-center w-auto lg:mx-52 md:mx-42 sm:mx-10 text-lg leading-6 font-serif">My Favorite episode of Demon Slayer is the season two movie. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. During the movie Tanjiro joins Inosuke Hashibira and Zenitsu Agatsuma on a mission to find
                the demon who has been attacking and killing passengers on the Mugen Train. Durning this mission they meet one of the Hashiras Kyojuro Rengoku who is there to aid them. The story continues with 
                Tanjiro asking questions regarding a breathing techique he is interested about. During the movie we get to see the highest ranking lower moon demon Enmu who has the power to put those who look into his eyes asleep, where they slowly die.
                Tanjiro joined with Nezuko, Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Kyojuro defeat this demon which causes the train to crash however, just when they believe they succeeded in their mission the upper rank demon Akaza shows up. 
                Kyojuro steps forward and fights Akaza, however in the end Akaza is able to defeat the Hashira Kyojuro. This movie is my favorite due to the action, emotions, and character development throughout the movie. 
                Tanjiro learns more about his rare breathing techique he is able to do, Inosuke and Zenitsu grow as characters and learn to cherish the life of the passengers on board the train rather than just their own, and Kyojuro
                is the first Hashira fight we see in this anime series and it has a heart breaking ending to it when he passes away after loosing the fight with Akaza.  </p>
